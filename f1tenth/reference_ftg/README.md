## Reference FTG

Follow-the-gap racing code transferred from [newcastle_race][1].

This is a known working solution, used as a reference for developing MPC-based algorithms.

Since the transferal of the code was meant to provide a good reference algorithm for the future development, most of the
constants have not been interpreted and instead copied directly to the relevant `constants` module.

It is therefore the least documented.
